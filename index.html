                <p> I am a junior web developer currently learning with Niyo Booytcamps. I have been doing web dev since
                    Sep
                    2023 and already learnt so much. At the moment I am learning HTML and CSS and using those 2
                    languages to create simple website. I have built 4 websites so far, first webpage was done in class
                    and
                    is what I use to practice new information I learnt. Second website is my daughter's page hair. I
                    want to
                    document her hair journey. The final 2 websites are part of my projects with Niyo bootcamps. I hope
                    you
                    enjoy having a browse around and if you need more information, do not hesitate to contact me.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Update</h3><br>
                <p> In week 3 we started on Javascript which we had been learning abour variables and functions. Also covered
                    how to
                    link javascript, html and css to make our webpages responsive.</p>

                <p> This is my 3rd website I built using HTML and CSS. The website is a mock bookstore shop where
                    you
                    can purchase books and hope we will have a service where you can return used books, soon. </p>

                <p> This is the second website I built using HTML and CSS. It is inspired by my daughter as since she
                    was born I have been motivated to make homemade natural hair products for her and avoid any products
                    that could have chemicals that could possibly cause more harm than good. The main aim for the
                    website is to document the my daughter's hair journey.</p>
